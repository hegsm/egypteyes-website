                            <p>"I'm Heather, and I created Egypt Eyes to help others experience the life-changing gift of clear vision. In 2023, I came to Egypt for what was meant to be a one-month scuba trip, but I fell in love with the country, and it became home.</p>
                            <p>For years, I dreamed of waking up and seeing the world clearly without glasses or contacts. But in the UK, the high cost and long wait made it feel out of reach. Thanks to my Egyptian friends, I discovered that the same advanced equipment and incredibly qualified doctors were available here for a fraction of the price.</p>
                            <p>I was nervous at first, alone in a new country, unsure of what to expect, but the care I received was exceptional. My consultation happened within days, and my treatment was done the very same day. It changed my life, and I'll never forget the feeling of opening my eyes with perfect vision.</p>
                            <p>After my own experience, I helped my friends through their journeys, and that inspired me to create Egypt Eyes, so others can feel supported, safe, and confident as they take this amazing step toward clearer sight."</p>
